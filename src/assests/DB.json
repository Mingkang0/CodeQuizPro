The execution order of the program is that the static block executes first, then the instance block, and then the constructor. Hence, the JVM will consider the value of 'a' and 'b' as 60 and 30 concerning the execution order. The value of 'a' = 10 and 'b' = 5 are of no use. And the value of variables 'c' and 'm' is 0 as we have not assigned any value to them."

Therefore, the array 'x' contains the values 120, 200, and 14.\n\nThe for loop iterates over the elements of the array and prints them, separated by spaces.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option (b) - '120 200 14'."

For example, 'import java.awt.*;' imports all the classes and interfaces of java.awt package. Whereas, 'import java.lang.Object;' only imports the Object class of the java.lang package.

In this case, the 'drive()' method in the 'ElectricCar' class is marked as 'final', so it cannot be overridden again.

            "explanation": "In this Java code, the 'Son' class extends the 'Father' class and overrides the 'car' method. When an object of the 'Son' class is created and its 'car' method is called, the overridden 'car' method in the 'Son' class will be invoked. This is an example of method overriding in Java, where the subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass. If the 'Son' class did not contain the 'car' method, then the 'car' method from the 'Father' class would be called."
